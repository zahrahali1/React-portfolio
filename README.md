# 20 React: React Portfolio

## Description

 I have created a React portfolio showcasing the projects I completed during my time at the bootcamp. The first page, titled "About Me," provides a brief introduction and includes images of my projects with links to to it's repo and GitHub repositories. The "Contact" section features a form for reaching out to me with any inquiries. Finally, the "Resume" page outlines the skills I acquired during the bootcamp, along with the qualifications I have achieved throughout my IT and programming career.
